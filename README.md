# Compiler-for-Custom-Language

The objectives of the PseudoL language was human readability derived from natural language patterns. This involves the use of English verbs like “plus” and “times” to replace the “+” and “*” symbols used in most mathematical languages. Unlike older languages (but more like modern, high-level ones) the operators come between their parameters, not before them. For instance, PseudoL reads “2 plus 4” to add the two numbers. So human readability and relevance to natural language is the main objective behind our project.
